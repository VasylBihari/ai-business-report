# Amazon eCommerce AI Executive Report

This project demonstrates an AI-assisted executive reporting system for Amazon-style eCommerce data.

I calculate all business metrics in Python first, then use AI only to interpret the results and generate a structured executive report — so the numbers are accurate and the insights are consistent.

The report analyzes:
- Revenue trend (regression-based)
- Marketplace and category concentration
- FBA vs FBM performance
- Refund exposure and operational risk
- Actionable strategic recommendations

The final deliverable is a decision-ready [executive PDF report](https://github.com/VasylBihari/ai-business-report/blob/main/Amazon_eCommerce_Performance_Report/output/business_report.pdf)
