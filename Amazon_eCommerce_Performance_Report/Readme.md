# Amazon eCommerce AI Executive Report

This project demonstrates an AI-assisted executive reporting system for Amazon-style eCommerce data.

The pipeline separates deterministic KPI calculation (Python) from structured AI interpretation (JSON-based), ensuring consistent metrics and eliminating hallucinated insights.

The report analyzes:
- Revenue trend (regression-based)
- Marketplace and category concentration
- FBA vs FBM performance
- Refund exposure and operational risk
- Actionable strategic recommendations

The final deliverable is a decision-ready [executive PDF report](https://github.com/VasylBihari/ai-business-report/blob/main/Amazon_eCommerce_Performance_Report/output/business_report%20(1).pdf)
