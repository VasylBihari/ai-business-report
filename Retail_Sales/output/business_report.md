# Executive Summary

1. **Profitability Discrepancy**: International orders generate significant revenue ($386,856) but have a low average margin ratio (59.55%), indicating that high shipping costs are eroding profitability.
2. **Shipping Cost Impact**: The correlation between shipping costs and margins is extremely negative (-1.0), suggesting that as shipping costs increase, profitability decreases sharply.
3. **High Shipping Segment Risk**: 908 orders fall into the high shipping segment (shipping ratio > 0.4), contributing only 9.59% to total revenue but with a concerning average margin ratio of 34.65%.
4. **False Growth Identification**: 1,404 orders represent 30.09% of total revenue but have below-average margins (67.44%), indicating a risk of over-reliance on high-revenue, low-profit orders.
5. **Actionable Recommendation**: Implement a tiered shipping policy that adjusts shipping costs based on order value to improve profitability on international shipments.

# Analysis of International Shipping

- **Profitability Concerns**: International shipping accounts for a substantial portion of total revenue but suffers from a significantly lower margin ratio compared to local orders. The average margin ratio for international orders is only 59.55%, indicating that high shipping costs are a major factor in reduced profitability.
- **Margin Leakage**: The high shipping segment, which includes 908 orders with an average shipping ratio of 40.45%, shows an alarming average margin ratio of 34.65%. This suggests that these orders are not only costly to ship but also yield low profits.
- **Shipping Costs**: The negative correlation between shipping costs and margins (-1.0) underscores the need for a strategic review of shipping policies to mitigate the impact of high shipping charges on profitability.

# False Growth Segment

- **Revenue vs. Profitability**: The false growth segment consists of 1,404 orders that contribute 30.09% of total revenue but have an average margin ratio of only 67.44%. This indicates that while these orders appear to drive sales, they do not contribute positively to overall profitability, posing a risk to sustainable growth.

# Decision Scenarios

1. **Revise Shipping Policy**: Introduce a tiered shipping policy that offers reduced rates for higher-value orders to incentivize larger purchases and improve margins on international shipments.
2. **Pricing Strategy Adjustment**: Consider adjusting pricing strategies for international orders to account for shipping costs, potentially increasing prices to maintain profitability without losing competitiveness.
